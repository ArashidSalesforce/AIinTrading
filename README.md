# AI in Trading Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed as part of the **AI in Trading Nanodegree** from Udacity. Each project focuses on a different aspect of quantitative trading, using machine learning and data analysis techniques to build, test, and evaluate trading strategies.

## Projects Overview

1. **Alpha Research and Factor Modeling**
   - This project involves researching and creating alpha factors, which are signals that can predict stock returns. The project covers the development of custom factors, their evaluation, and their integration into a portfolio.

2. **Backtesting**
   - In this project, I developed and evaluated trading strategies using backtesting. The focus is on testing the robustness of strategies by simulating them on historical data, allowing for analysis of their performance and risk.

3. **Breakout Strategy**
   - The breakout strategy project explores the concept of momentum trading by implementing a strategy that captures price movements that break through predefined levels. The project includes performance analysis and optimization of the strategy parameters.

4. **Combined Signals for Enhanced Alpha**
   - This project combines multiple alpha factors to create a more robust and predictive trading signal. The emphasis is on blending different factors and optimizing their weights to maximize returns while controlling for risk.

5. **NLP on Financial Statements**
   - This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze financial statements and extract meaningful insights that can be used in trading strategies. The focus is on sentiment analysis and its application in predicting stock movements.

6. **Sentiment Analysis with Neural Networks**
   - In this project, I built and trained a neural network model to perform sentiment analysis on financial news and social media data. The project explores the impact of sentiment on market prices and integrates the sentiment scores into trading strategies.

7. **Smart Beta and Portfolio Optimization**
   - This project focuses on smart beta strategies, which involve creating portfolios that aim to outperform traditional market-cap-weighted indices. The project includes techniques for portfolio optimization and risk management.

8. **Trading with Momentum**
   - The momentum trading project involves developing strategies that capitalize on the continuation of existing market trends. The project explores various momentum indicators and their application in creating profitable trading strategies.

## How to Navigate the Projects

To view and explore the work I've done in each project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project folder of interest.
2. Open the file named `project_x_starter.ipynb`, where `x` corresponds to the specific project you're interested in.

This will open the Jupyter notebook where the project work is documented, including the code, analysis, and results.
